This is my first project as a TOP learner. I'll try to use my knowledge to:

1. Use basic terminal commands to manage folders and files;
2. Organize my project as it should be, using the correct terminology and directory paths;
3. Demonstrate my current HTML knowledge state to basic functions, like setting boilerplate, using tags and it's attributes well, handling anchors, etc.;
4. Use the knowledge with Git to manage my project into modified, staged and commited changes;
5. Use github repository for my first project;
6. Stabilish good comments for my git commits;

LESGO!
